        <p>I’m Gül Oymak—a computer scientist in Zürich, currently doing an M.Sc. in Computer Science (Machine Intelligence) at ETH Zürich. I’m curious about AI in general, but my niche is AI in finance. Most weeks you’ll find me tinkering with small personal projects: cleaning and stitching datasets, trying simple forecasting ideas, and exploring how post-training (SFT + RL) shapes model behavior in practice. I like problems that ask for both good theory and practical tradeoffs, and my goal is to build tools that are understandable, reliable, and actually useful.</p>
        <p>Outside work, I’m the friend who cooks too much Mediterranean food, swims whenever the weather cooperates, and knows which second-hand shops have the best vintage finds. Pilates keeps me steady; lake walks make me stay. Originally from Turkey, I’ve lived in Zürich long enough to feel like a local, and I love the quiet rhythm of the trams and the small surprises you notice when you slow down.</p>
        <p>If you’d like to contact me or work together on something, feel free to reach out.</p>
