        <p>I’m Gül Oymak—a computer scientist in Zurich, currently pursuing an M.Sc. in Computer Science (majoring in Machine Intelligence) at ETH Zurich. I’m broadly interested in AI, with a focus on AI in finance. Lately I’ve been exploring robust time-series modeling and forecasting, risk/anomaly detection, and the post-training stack for language models (SFT + RL) including data curation, reward modeling, and DPO/PPO workflows. 
          I care about end-to-end reliability—clean datasets, reproducible experiments, disciplined evaluation, and clear cost/latency trade-offs—so my projects often include simple backtesting harnesses, monitoring, and tools that make model behavior easier to understand and operate. I like problems that ask for both good theory and practical tradeoffs, and my goal as a machine learning engineer is to build tools that are understandable, reliable, and actually useful. </p>
        <p>Outside work, I’m the friend who cooks too much Mediterranean food, swims whenever the weather cooperates, and knows which second-hand shops have the best vintage finds. Pilates keeps me steady; lake walks make me stay. Originally from Turkey, I’ve lived in Zürich long enough to feel like a local, and I love the quiet rhythm of the trams and the small surprises you notice when you slow down.</p>
        <p>If you’d like to contact me or work together on something or share some ideas, you can always reach me out!</p>
